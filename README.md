## What inspired us?

The beauty of the internet is followed by a shadow of twisted anarchy manifested through abuse and harassment.

> 59% of U.S. teens have been bullied or harassed online (Pew Research Center, 2018).

> Students who experienced bullying or cyberbullying are nearly 2 times more likely to attempt suicide (Hinduja & Patchin, 2018).

The problem of cyberbullying inspired us because its devastating impact on teenagers increases as the internet grows and as we become more dependent on technology. Yet, there are no measures taken to improve the protection against hatred and harassment on the internet. **Thus, in a naive attempt to stand between hateful comments and vulnerable viewers, we decided to make Lazaretto...**

It's time to confine the toxicity. It's time to put it in a *lazaretto*.

## What inspired us?

The beauty of the internet is followed by a shadow of twisted anarchy manifested through abuse and harassment.

> "59% of U.S. teens have been bullied or harassed online" (Pew Research Center, 2018).

> "Students who experienced bullying or cyberbullying are nearly 2 times more likely to attempt suicide" (Hinduja & Patchin, 2018).

The problem of cyberbullying inspired us because its devastating impact on teenagers increases as the internet grows and as we become more dependent on technology. Yet, there are no measures taken to improve the protection against hatred and harassment online, especially for minors. **Thus, in an attempt against all odds to stand between hateful comments and vulnerable viewers, we decided to make Lazaretto...**

#### It's time to confine the toxicity. It's time to put it in a *lazaretto*.


## What did we learn?

Throughout this process we were enlightened by new knowledge while being challenged by newly encountered problems.

On one hand, this was all new to us so everything we made, we learned along the way. Everything from making a chrome extension, YouTube APIs, tensorflow.js for machine learning, web scraping, and using DCP - it's all new to us, we've never used any of these technologies before.

Make no mistake, **it was painful to learn all this in a two day hackathon**... AND make the actual product at the same time. It was hours -- nay, two whole days -- of scouring deprecated documentations, stackoverflow posts from 2010 which just said "no, you're wrong", and of the good old console.log("fart") to debug where the code stopped working.  

At the end of the day, we learned a whole lot of new technologies that we can now use with more fluency. We learned how to make chrome extensions to automate our social media browsing, machine learning to classify how mad we are when SyntaxError occurs, and a whole world of super computing! *This was an invaluable learning experience, so thank you to everyone involved in this Hackathon!*

On the social side of things, we learned a lot about cyberbullying. Middle school counselors often tell us not to cyberbully, but we laugh at this and move on. However, this is a serious problem with absolutely no regulation right now. We learned a lot about the dangers of it and the impact it has on people, particularly children.

## How did we build this project?

Whoa, don't even get me started!

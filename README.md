## What inspired us?

The beauty of the internet is followed by a shadown of twisted anarchy manifested with abuse and harassment. 59% of U.S. teens have been bullied or harassed online (Pew Research Center, 2018). Students who experienced bullying or cyberbullying are nearly 2 times more likely to attempt suicide (Hinduja & Patchin, 2018).

We say it's time to confine the toxicity.
          **its time to put it in a *lazaretto*.**
